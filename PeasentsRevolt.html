                        But this was not just any war, it was a war between the upper and lower ends of the Feudal system. After the black death, there was a lot less workers and therefore, the worker was worth more to the lord. Lords then had to start competing for workers and they kept offering more and more money. However, the Peasants did not want money - they wanted freedom. When the poll tax came around the very next year, the Peasants refused to pay and killed the collector. <br> <br> Kent and Essex marched into London and freed John Ball, someone who had been campaigning for freedom for all. The 14 year old King went to meet them, however mass confusion led to the meeting never happening. Later, they met again, however whilst Wat Tyler was speaking to the King, he was killed and then all of the others were killed, later on. <br> <br> There was no happy ending, however the rich took the Peasants more seriously from then on and no King/Queen attempted to collect a poll tax until the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher in 1981.
