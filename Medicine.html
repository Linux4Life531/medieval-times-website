                        In Medieval times, there was not much knowledge about medicine. The majority of the knowledge came from the crusades and from the eastern world. There were a lot of muslims in this area, who started the knowledge we have today. Muslims have taught us a lot. Muslims first introduced us into base 10, which thrives throughout the world today. They also showed us what soap is and antibacterial wipes and we gained alot of knowledge from them. <br> <br> The main reason they found this out was that they started schools of medicine and universities. Anyway, medieval doctors believed a lot in superstition in England, and therefore there were some very painful medicine's, for example if you had a headache they would drill into your head to let the evil spirits out! The treatements for many things were very painful and therefore people did not live for that long in medieval times.
