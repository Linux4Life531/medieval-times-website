                        The Black Death was a disease that originated in China. The disease killed 1/3 of the population of Europe and caused what is known as the Peasants Revolt. Here is what the Black Death is and why it was so deadly. <br> <br> The Black Death started in China and was spread to England and Europe through trade. The virus was so deadly for a few reasons, firstly, the lymph nodes (body protectors) could not deal with it. The problem that the people faced was that doctors did not know anything about viruses. The doctors thought that it was bad spirits and due to the amount of deaths the doctors ended up hiding and not treating patients. This caused the world to go into a complete state of panic. <br> <br> The Black Death wiped out cities and in World War 2, towns were found again and were proven that once, people had lived there: but the virus had killed the population, and the streets were full of bodies.
