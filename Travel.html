                        Travelling was very hard in te Medieval times.

                    Travelling was unsafe for many reasons, and here is why. Medieval England had lots of small towns, however no real roads between them. Whenever you wanted to go somewhere, you had to go via dirty muddy paths, no matter how much money you owned, etc. The thing your money changed was your mode of transport. <br> <br> If you were rich then you would ride in a covered wagon, but if you were poor you would just have to walk. The roads were also very dangerous as you don't have a map. You could easily get lost and end up in a "black spot" with loads of "beasts" around. <br> <br> Beasts were considered to be outlaws running around on the roads and animals who were dangerous. Most roads were also very dangerous due to the crime commited by the outlaws on them, they would often attack you if they saw you coming and there was no law enforcements to stop them.
