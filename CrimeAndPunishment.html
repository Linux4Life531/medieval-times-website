                        Crime and Punishment in Medieval times were grim.

                        Crimes were committed in the Medieval times. There has been multiple attempts to stop them, some failing and some working well. Here, we will talk about what went well and what did not. <br> <br> Firstly, the way to stop crime at night in Medieval times was by having nightwatchmen, who waited up all night and watched over the town, looking for people around between 8pm and 4am. If they could see you, then you would get punished. Another way of stopping crimes were through the hue and cry, where the person being attacked would scream for help, and then everyone in the village would have to help, otherwise they would get fined. <br> <br> Finally, punishment was very grim. Some of the main punishments were: hanging, stocks and other similar painful machines. Finally, there was no court. You would be trialled using ordeal by water (thrown into water, if you float then you are guilty, sink, innocent (but highly likely to be dead, so)), ordeal by combat (fight the accusser, whoever wins is innocent) and ordeal by fire (hold a hot iron bar and if the wound does not go after 3 days then you are innocent.
