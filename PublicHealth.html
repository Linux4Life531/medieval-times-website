                        Public Health in Medieval Times Was Bad. <strong>Period</strong>.

                        Public health in the Medieval times was very bad. There are multiple reasons for this and we will go through them all. Firstly, people went to the toilet in bad places, for example, the middle of the street! People barely used toilets and the streets were often very unclean. This made villages very unsanitary. <br> <br> Next, that same waste was then put into the river. Now that may seem like a logical idea, until you find out that they also drank from that very same river! How disgusting!!! <br> <br> These are the main reasons for bad hygiene in Medieval times, and therefore bad health.
